    "# Credit Scorecard Model Analysis\n",

    "- ### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "  This project aims to create a scorecard by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Banks play a crucial role in market economies. They decide who can get finance and on what terms and can make or break investment decisions. For markets and society to function, individuals and companies need access to credit.Credit scoring algorithms, which make a guess at the probability of default, are the method banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Finally we will predict the probability of default (PD) for the first 300 values in the test set to show the effectiveness of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Project process** \n",
    "\n",
    "The main development process of credit risk rating model is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtain data and datab description.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. EDA - exploratory data analysis and descriptive statistics, including the overall data volume, the proportion of good and bad customers, the types of data, the missing rate of variables, variable frequency analysis, histogram visualization, variable correlation visualization, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data preprocessing mainly includes data cleaning, missing value processing, abnormal value processing and so on. We need to convert the original data layer by layer into modelable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Variable selection\n",
    "    - Through the methods of statistics and machine learning, select the variables that have the most significant impact on the default state. There are many common variable selection methods, including iv, feature importance, variance and so on. Here, we choose IV value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The main difficulties in model development and scorecard modeling are woe box division, score stretching and variable coefficient calculation. Among them, woe box division is the difficulty in the score card, which requires rich statistical knowledge and business experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Logistic Regression Modelling- Predict PD\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Model verification: verify the discrimination ability, prediction ability, stability, sorting ability, etc. of the model, form a model evaluation report, and draw a conclusion whether the model can be used. Model validation is not completed at one time, but after modeling, before and after the model goes online. Model development and maintenance is a cycle, not completed at one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Generate Scorecard\n",
    "    - The credit score card is generated according to the variable coefficient and WOE value of Logistic regression. The score card is convenient for business explanation. It has been used for decades and is very stable. It is deeply loved by the financial industry. The method is to convert the probability score of Logistic model into a standard score of 300-900.\n",
